        <p class="text-case1"> The client is Creative Media for Social Change. They develop creative media tools, such as virtual environments, board games and interactive artworks. They investigate how they can use this effectively for a more inclusive and sustainable world. Creative Media for Social Change is one of the seven professorships and three special professorships that together form the FDMCI knowledge center. The knowledge center is part of the Faculty of Digital Media & Creative Industry within the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. </p>
        <p class="text-case1"> The project is about how people currently use social media to gain news and knowledge, but there is a lot of fake news and disinformation being spread in the digital landscape.
        The deliverables of this project were: </p>

        <li class="lijst"> A museum intervention in Museum Beeld & Geluid to gather research insights for the continuity of the project </li>
        <li class="lijst"> A tool that can be connected to other social media, to help users navigate information on social media. </li>
</div>

<div>
<p class="text-case2"> The aim of the project is to help people navigate online news and information and to become more aware of what they consume. </p>

<p class="text-case2"> After conducting extensive research, which consisted of desk research, benchmark, an experiment, interviews, and a workshop, we formulated a more targeted problem definition. We have created a 'How Might We': How can we help teenagers aged 14 to 18 recognize which content is or is not trustworthy on Instagram and Tiktok and make the platforms more transparent about the truth of the content? </p>

<p class="text-case2"> How did we arrive at this design challenge, and how did we incorporate it into a solution?

     <strong> Experiment </strong> <br>
       We (4 people, different nationalities) observed our own social media accounts, Instagram and Tiktok, for 1 week. We have also created two new accounts where we are 16 years old. <br>
        <br>
       The purposes of observing our own social media accounts are:
</p>
       <div class="list">
          <li> Observing our behavior on social media </li>
          <li> Understanding what information looks like when it is not true </li>
          <li> Identify how much fake news we receive on social media </li>
          <li> How our interaction affects the type of content that appears on our feed </li>

      <p class="text-case1"> The purposes of observing new accounts are: </p>

      <div class="list">

      <p class="text-case1"> <strong> Workshop </strong> <br>
        It was previously stated that we had to organize a museum intervention in Beeld & Geluid. We chose to organize a workshop at a school instead because this way we could reach our target group more.

            <br>
          It was a 1 hour workshop at the international school in Haarlem. We divided ourselves in two so that there were two per class.  </p>
            <br>
            <div class="list">
                <li> Class 1 was 41 teenagers aged 13-14 years old with different nationalities </li>
                <li> Class 2 were 32 teenagers aged 14-15 years old with different nationalities </li>
                <li> We opened the workshop with an introduction where we explained what we were doing here and what we were going to do in the next hour. Then we did an exercise where the students had to indicate whether the content we showed was real or fake by walking to one side of the classroom (fake content) or the other side of the classroom (real content). </li>
                <li> Then in class 1 we had a co-creation session and in class 2 we had a feedback session on three of our concepts. </li>

        There is a clear process for the flowchart, wireframes and UI / High fidelity prototype tools, which I will also explain in more detail. <br>
        <br>
        After applying various ideation methods and writing down all the insights from the workshop, we arrived at a concept. It is a concept with multiple components, so we have mapped this out with a flowchart per component. Based on the various flowcharts, we started making wireframes for each part. Here we looked at what Tiktok currently looks like. This way we could clearly see how the different parts worked together. After discussing the wireframes, we quickly moved on to creating a HIFI prototype. We have of course tested this and iterations have taken place.

        <h2 class="header"> Does my product work? </h2>

<div class="information">
        <p class=text-case1> To know if my product works, I will answer the design challenge. The design challenge is the design question that we made at the beginning of the project that incorporates the purpose of the end product.

 <br> <br> Design challenge: How can we help teens aged 14 to 18 recognize what content is or is not trustworthy on Instagram and Tiktok and make the platforms more transparent about the truth of the content?

<br><br>
 <strong> Is it now more recognizable which content is or is not reliable on Instagram and Tiktok? </strong> <br><br>
Yes, this is a good first step towards a solution to help people recognize fake news on social media. This can be seen because we make the platforms more transparent by indicating through labels what kind of content is now visible. This allows the user to decide for themselves what to do with the content, but we have provided the information in the clearest way possible about what kind of content they are currently seeing. </p>

<div class="text-case2">
  <p>At the end of this project we still had a week to think about what we (individually) wanted to add to the project. I chose to map our research thoroughly because I thought the research was so important and because it was so extensive.
We have benefited greatly from our research and have used many different methods. Would you like to read and see more about this? Then view the project: <a class="link" href="mapping-en.html">'Mapping the findings' </a>.
