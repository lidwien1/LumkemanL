        <h1 class="header"> Platform Ucentri </h1>

<div class="information">
  <div>
        <p class="text-case1"> The client is the start-up company Ucentri in Amsterdam. Ucentri is a network of digital companies that helps SMEs in the targeted use of these digitally specialized companies. Ucentri's customers are SMEs that come to Ucentri for help with their digital transformation for, for example, design, IT landscape or market awareness. The members of Ucentri are the specialized companies in this and Ucentri therefore links the right companies to the customer. </p>

        <p class="text-case1"> The problem at Ucentri is that the value of the current platform is not being seen because it currently does not work as the user might expect. As a result, the platform is not currently being used. The process and project management of a project should be trackable on this platform.
</div>

<div>
          <p class="text-case2">  The purpose of my product is to ensure that the entire process can take place within the Ucentri platform. All the features used in the tools will be integrated into the Ucentri platform, making the entire project easier! </p>

<div class="information">

        <p class="text-case1"> Another goal of my product is that users have a better awareness of where they are in the process or project, they have a clear overview of what they need to do and when. Notifications from the platform of project updates make everyone more involved in the project. From now on, the administrative part will largely be done on the platform, which provides a better overview for all parties involved.</p>

        <p class="text-case2"> A good overview of how communication is going now and which communication tools are used can be seen in the images below. The two images on the left show the overview in the proposal phase of the current and expected situation. On the right you see two images in the project phase, also of the current and expected situation. This shows that many communication tools are used within the current process. You can see in the video above that my product is a solution to this problem because everything can be found on 1 platform. </p>

        <p class="text-case1"> After a lot of research that consisted of: interviews, desk research, benchmark creation, design pattern search, participant observation, proof of concept and user testing, I created a requirements list and a findings list. During the design process, I kept these lists next to me as a kind of checklist to ensure that everything could be found in the product. In the video below you can see a video of the product and how it works.</p>

<div class="information">

        <p class=text-case1> To know if my product works, I will answer the design challenge. The design challenge is the design question that is made at the beginning of the project that incorporates the purpose of the end product. <br> <br>

        <strong> Have I integrated the process on the existing platform? </strong> <br>
        <br> Yes, I have this, by adjusting the current screens. I have also added several screens to the platform. As a result, everything about the project can now be found in 1 platform and the value of the platform is now clearly highlighted. <br> <br>
<div>
      <p class=text-case2>  <strong> Can Ucentri and the members of Ucentri go through the process in a clear and structured manner? </strong><br>
<br> Yes, they can do this, as this emerged from the user testing and validation conversations with the target group. Thanks to the new way of navigating and the breadcrumps, they are always aware of where they are on the platform.
The personal process at the top of each page gives them a good overview of the project. </p>
