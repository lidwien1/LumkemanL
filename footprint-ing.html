        <h1 class="header"> Carbon footprint feature - ING </h1>

<div class="information">

<div>
        <p class="text-case1"> The client for this project is ING. ING is a large bank that has been focusing a lot on sustainability recently. With more than 37 million customers, ING's business activities have a significant impact on society and the environment. <br> <br>
ING is currently working on a feature for the CO2 footprint that is related to ING's Insight function. You can see the CO2 emissions in KG per issue.</p>
        <p class="text-case1"> How can we provide meaningful advice and encourage you to take action based on the C02 data of your expenses? < This is the design challenge that ING has drawn up. <br> <br>
The goal of this design challenge is to discover articles, visualizations and nudges that will result in behavioral change based on insights from our research. </p>

</div>

<div>

  <p class="text-case2"> Points we should pay attention to while designing this new feature are: </p>
  <li class="lijst1"> Exploring multiple ways the data can be visualized to drive action. </li>
  <li class="lijst1"> Improve carbon footprint literacy. </li>
  <li class="lijst1"> How we can inspire action without feeling annoying. </li>
  <li class="lijst1"> The most important thing is finding and validating ways we can push our customers towards sustainable behavior that is good for them and the planet. </li>

  <p class="text-case2"> Some of the deliverables were: </p>
  <li class="lijst1"> Research-based current and estimated customer journey. </li>
  <li class="lijst1"> 1 iterated and validated prototype. </li>
  <li class="lijst1"> Support each of these with testing alternative solutions and providing best practices. Show us what worked and what didn't. </li>
</div>
</div>

<div class="information">

<div class="information">
  <div>
          <p class="text-case1"> Our research consisted of three phases: 40% <strong>understanding</strong>, 40% <strong>exploring</strong> and 20% <strong>creating</strong>.</p>
          <p class="text-case1"> <strong>Understand:</strong> <br> So first we want to understand the assignment, the problem and the target group. The target group at this point was everyone. That's why we created a survey that we're sending to almost 60 people of different ages. This survey was helpful, we got some great insights and we now have a target audience.
<br> <br>
Target group <br>
People aged 18 to 35 who change their lifestyle from student to working life who already exhibit sustainable behavior but want to improve this behavior.
          <br> <br>
          Two insights <br>
          First insight: many people do not know what their carbon footprint means. You can see this very well in these statistics that emerged from our research:
          <div class="information">
          <img class="img-poster4" alt="poster4" src="images/inzicht1.png">
          <img class="img-poster5" alt="poster5" src="images/inzicht2.png">
        </div>

          <p class="text-case1"> But another insight emerged from the research. This means that people think that big companies need to change to reduce CO2 emissions. And that they think that changing as an individual will not positively contribute to climate change. </p>

          <p class="text-case1"> <strong> Visualize: </strong> <br> Data visualization is the creation of visual representations of data. These views clearly communicate insights from data through charts and graphs. In the field of business intelligence, these visualizations help users make better data-driven decisions.
<br> <br>
Our desk research has shown that telephone calls are a very good way to visualize CO2 emissions.

  </div>

  <div>
          <p class="text-case2"> How to motivate people and change their behavior? <br> After doing a lot of research on motivating people to change their behavior and talking to a behavior change expert named Cogo, we came up with a list of points that are important to motivate people and change their behavior.
            <br>
            Our desk research has shown that telephone calls are a very good way to visualize CO2 emissions.</p> <br>
            <li class="lijst1"> Achievements and goals are a good way to motivate people. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> Try to challenge customers with realistic goals. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> Small changes can have big consequences when implemented on a larger scale. Small goals to keep the customer involved can help him step by step to become more sustainable. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> A gamification idea can also work, try to encourage customers to make more sustainable purchases. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> A sustainable streak is a good way to keep users engaged. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> Try to keep the customers engaged with the carbon footprint feature. Even if it's weekly or even monthly, changing their sustainable lifestyle can have a big impact. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> Rewarding customers for sustainable progress can be a good way to keep them engaged and change their daily behavior. </li>
            <li class="lijst1"> Reward customers for changing their behavior. </li>


            <p class="text-case2"> Concept: <br>
              After analyzing the research, we started brainstorming. After brainstorming, we defined the ideas into categories. We had three categories that contained the most ideas. The categories were: Collaboration, Visualization/Progress and Reward, Nudging, Motivation. All these categories together form one concept.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Create:</strong>
              <br>
              After making a first prototype, we started testing with the target group. They gave good feedback and overall everyone understood the concept well and were able to click through the prototype. We made minor adjustments for the second version of the prototype.

        <h2 class="header"> Does my product work? </h2>

<div class="information">
        <p class=text-case1> To know if my product works, I will answer the design challenge. The design challenge is the design question that we posed at the beginning of the project that incorporates the purpose of the end product.

<br> <br> Design challenge: How can we provide meaningful advice and encourage you to take action based on the C02 data of your expenditure?

<div class="text-case2">
        <p> <strong> Is the advice meaningful? </strong> </p>
         <p> I believe it is meaningful advice because we give the user a good insight into what their C02 emissions are based on their expenditure. We have done this in the clearest way possible. We have conducted extensive research and through user testing it has been concluded that our method of mapping CO2 emissions provides a better picture than users previously had.
           <br>
           We have also provided feasible tips or tasks to reduce the user's C02.
     <br>
   Finally, we responded to the user's opinion by also helping ING become more sustainable by carrying out assignments.  </p>
